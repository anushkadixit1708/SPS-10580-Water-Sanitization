# Water Sanitation in India
Water sanitation is one of the major issues faced by the country. A large amount of population is
drinking water which looks “clean” but is ridden with harmful impurities such as arsenic or is
overly saline and thus rendered undrinkable by health standards. This problem is particularly
more intense in rural India where people cannot afford to purify water at such a large scale or
install high end water purifiers in their homes. The impact of this is not only on the health, but
also on the economic and social development of areas.<br>
<br>

An analysis of the impurities present in the water in different regions across the country tells us
about the magnitude of the issue and just hoe many habitations are affected by the problem.
Understanding the problem well, we can derive effective solutions to combat the problem which
are region specific and help supply water fit for drinking to people in the heart of the country.
